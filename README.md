# BNR-BeatBox

this is my version of the BeatBox app, from the Big nerd ranch book.
they used data binding, and in my project i used view binding

also, only now i have decided to push my projects to github, and the "suck commit" is from the tutorial am watching

thanks in advance for anyone (no one probably) that will stop by here
